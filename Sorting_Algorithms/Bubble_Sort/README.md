// LOGIC FOR BUBBLE SORT

NOTE : This arranges the list in an ascending order
Step 1: Take a list of numbers.
Step 2: Start from the first number in the list
Step 3 : Compare this number with the number next to it. 
Step 4: If the next number is smaller replace it with the first number.
Step 5 : Move forward to the next number and repeat Step 3 and Step 4.
Step 6 : Iterate till the last number.
Note : Now the smallest number is in the first place.
Step 7 : Reiterate over the loop from the second number upwards.

Note : After a definite number of passes the list is arranged in a sorted order.s
