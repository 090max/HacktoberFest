This algorithm is one of the simplest.
Step 1 : Get a list or an array of numbers 
Step 2 : Input the key element(i.e. The element you want to search for)
Step 3 : Move thorugh the elements one by one starting from the first element
Step 4 : Check if the first element is the key element. If not Move to the next element
Step 5 : Repeat Step 4 for all elements.
Step 6 : If any element matches the key element then the element has been found.
Step 7 : Else just say that the element is not in the list or array.

NOTE : 
* Step 3 can be implemented through a simple for loop.
Putting a condition inside to check if the element matches the key element.
